# Simple-Calculator-Logic

I built this simple calculator in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript for fresh/new developers/students for learning purposes.

In this simple calculator, I did only simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, division, multiplication. I used very simple programming logic to do these arithmetic operations.
